Here is an old commercial that is obviously fallacious:　“有太阳的地方就有朝阳轮胎”。   
   
In the beginning of our market economy products are very scarce. Promotion is the most important part for the sales. But the quality of the promotion such as quality of commercials is very low just the same as the self-dependent innovation of the products. I think the most main reason is market in our country is very very huge and the most customers are less-educated. Less-educated customer need no high-qulity commercials. Entrepreneurs know that and then underestimated the average IQ of customers. Think about "脑白金".
