Global migration intention survey showed that China's attraction for immigrants is minus 6%. And Sina.com survey found that 88.7% of the respondents wanted to emigrate while those don't is only 2.4%. Like 95% of the respondents on Sina.com survey I also agree that emigration is a normal and reasonable issue that has nothing to do with patriotism. Unlike the majority who favor of America or say north America I prefer Australia, considering physical health, social condition and reproduction.

In China pollution and food safety is the most serious threat to people's physical health. We all know that pollution especially in metropolis is a serious problem for citizen's health in China. Zhong Nanshan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, has said that the country's air pollution is a problem worse than SARS. Except the air pollution, water pollution is also a tough nut to crack. State media reported that sixty per cent of underground water in China which is officially monitored is too polluted to drink directly. What's more food may leed us to sterility. Once on the train a woman asked me a question which shocked me. Do you know what kind of drug is used often in order to accelerate animals' growth? Contraceptive is used even for fruit, she told me. However, according to statisticbrain.com Australia ranked the 3rd on the list of Countries Ranked by Air Pollution. For water pollution, Australia ranked 20th on waterinfo.net for water quality, but China ranked 84. When it comes to food safty, a story would let us know how strict it is for Australia's restaurant to ensure food hygiene quality. Once a Chinese-Australia went to a restaurant runned by a former mayor of Melbourne for lunch or whatever. After his food servered, he found a cockroach in it. The result is that the restaurateur was fined 70k Australian Dollar and the restaurant was ordered to suspend, which would make an ordinary restaurateur went to broke. 

Social condition includes relative fair opportunities, lower corruption rate, easier express your voice, surf websites freely, more dignity for the ordinary, and etc. Almost everyone who has no good background including me suffered once or more from corruption in China. When I was a middle school student all students in grade one have to be reassigned. Of course, I was not afraid that because I aced out the math exam and other subjects are also very good. But unexpectedly, I found name listed not in key classes' list. Later I knew that a student's father bribed the headmaster and replaced me. Like all advanced countries Australia is a free country where you would state your opinions openly and surf the Internet with no GFW. Humanitarianism has nothing to do with Chinese ordinary people but Australia has a very egalitarian culture. Today China is like a huge colosseum, and only the strongest species may survive, and triumph, and gain the glory and riches. And the innocent might really have to suffer. Do you agree that China is giving up a part of its people? 

Childbearing policy and education plus other kinds of welfare is another aspect that attract foreigners. To keep the number of people from growing too fast, the Chinese government limits couples to one child. However Australia government has offered couples incentives to have more children. Australia's welfare system makes it easy to meet minimum survive standards for its people. When common people can gain the most fundamental survival guarantee, they would fully engage in the work. So, you need not to worry about extra-birth and the burden of raising a child. Furthermore, education system there is much better than the system in China. And there are absolutely no substandard milk powder and foodstuff added contraceptive in the market for your kids.

Many people find some cons of emigration. Feasibility, relationship and life convenience are major scruples. 

Some people say that it is very difficult to immigrate into Australia. Let's talk about the ways first. Two programs are available for the immigrants: Business Migration Program and Highly Skilled Migrant Program. Many Chinese migrate through investment immigration schemes. The maximum amount of investment is 5 million AUD and the minimum is 800 thousand AUD. Yes, ordinary people obviously would not invest so much money. But I don't think the youth cannot gain at least 5 million RMB at a certain period of time let's say 5 to 10 years. If one has a skill Australia need he would migrate through highly skilled immigration schemes. If one's current occupation, or an occupation in which one has engaged in for several years, is on the Skilled Occupation List, then he/she can apply for permanent residency to Australia under the skilled categories. I think if you are laborious and excelsior you can meet all the requirements.

Yes you have to part from your relatives and friends and need to build new relationship in a whole new country. Don't you think that the Internet would connect you with your relatives and friends in China? To say the least, do you know how many people in China are leaving their home in village to the big city like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou? If I am one of them I would rather go to Australia. Plus, it takes only about 10 hours fly from Australia to China. 

Life convenience is another problem they said. It is not convenient to shop in Australia. Online shopping is very inconvenient. But I want to say that car and infrigerator would solve all problems.
