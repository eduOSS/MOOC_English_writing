In the past three units, we have discussed four prewriting techniques, such as focused free-writing, listing, clustering, and making an outline. Writers select the prewriting strategy that is most effective for them and best suited to the form and purpose of their writing. Some writers may even use more than one strategies to explore a topic. Your assignment for this week is to develop a detailed outline to explore the issue of "Sex Education in China." Which prewriting strategy did you, or will you, use? Why? 
    Clustering, of cause. I am used to use mind tool Xmind to cluster my ideas and structure the article when writing. I think strategies used in mind mapping is the best, at least for me. It makes the article logical for both the details and the whole essay's hierarchical structure. 
         Please review your working process of the outline after you finish it, and answer the following questions below to share your experimental experience with the class. 
         1. Which strategy generated the deepest thinking? How and why?
         When it comes to the deepest thinking, focused free-writing feels right to me. I always think illogically, thus only that way would help me to get ideas that flash upon my mind randomly. I try to grasp everything I would and write them down. Often most thoughts are unworthy but always the left give me what I search for. After clustering, adding some details and revising I would get a satisfying outline very often.
         2. Which activity helped you collect most supporting details? How and why?
         I think it's listering. Only listering let me think what I need to support the argument the most are. Otherwise some details which might be very important would be ignored. Often I find some logic among all the details I have got and list them in a certain order then to find others indispensable.
