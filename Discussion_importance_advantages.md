## In what ways is English writing important to you?
English writing is essential to me, considering the following reasons.
* Firstly, learning English writing is an 'urgent and important' occupation to me. Aspiring to be an exceptional programmer, I need to write down experiences of programming both for sharing and communication with programmers allover the world. How to describe questions I encounter on Quora, Stack Overflow or Yahoo! Answer is a problem of great urgency. 
* Secondly, learning how to compose especially in English has strong repercussion for me. So learning English writing is an 'important but not urgent' matter. Here is the related reference linking.

## What are the advantages of an on-line writing course?
* On-line writing course has many advantages including time & space flexibility, high quality course accessibility for almost everybody and broader and more diverse discussion circle than traditional course. Fixed classroom and class timetable is unbearable. Often open source course-wares are of high quality and broad effect. We, students have different backgrounds which would be better for expanding each other's horizon. Plus, e-portfolio also play an important role.
