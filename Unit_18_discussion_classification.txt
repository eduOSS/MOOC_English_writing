Together with Windows Vista they comprised over 90% of desktop OS market share. Among Windows family, Window 7 is the most popular one, Windows XP the second. 

Unix and Unix-like operating systems including BSD and its descendants and Linux and GNU. BSD stands for Berkeley Software Distribution, which includes FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
