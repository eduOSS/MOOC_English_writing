Some people think that "description" is the most important skill in academic communication. Do you agree or disagree? Why? 

I don't agree that opinion. 
Description is only one type of wrting methods. Reality problems are very complex let alone academic matter, thus various patterns should be mixed up for a better effect, such as narration, process analysis, comparison and contrast, etc. In some types of writing, description is indispensable but in others it isn't, like philosophy paper and mathmatic essay. The most important skill in academic communication would not be regarded so much to description as to any pattern of logic and coherence.
