classification

where does the time go?
I am a postgraduate student and I find I am always very busy. So I want to find where does my time go exactly. All time-consuming activities can be categorized into four parts: sleeping, working, recreation and trifles.  

Sleeping often includes night off and noon break. I often sleep at 11 p.m. and get up at about quarter to 6 a.m. Because of less than 7 hours sleep at night I need a catnap after noon. About 7 hours plus about half an hour equal to or less than 8 hours, i.e., less than one third of a day. 

Next is the most time-sonsuming part: work and study. In the early morning three hours would be spend to lean English. Writing or reading papers would cost me the rest two hours. After lunch and a break four to five hours are used to programming. At night from 7:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. I will program or reading. Yeah, I work about 12 hours a day on average. 

The terrible thing is recreation, I know almost nothing about recreation. I never watch movies nor do I watch TV shows. Considering physical exercise will fill me with joy, I would presume one and a half hours are scheduled to have fun every day.    

There are 2.5 hours left to do trifles: eating, walking, occasional shopping, etc.

Absolutely, these years' overwhelming workload and survival pressure have made me exhausted.
