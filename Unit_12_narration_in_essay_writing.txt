Part III: Writing to narrate
    writing to narrate 
        1) selection of the point of view(1st-person narrator vs. 3rd-person narrator); 
        first person approach: to describe events in your own life by using the 1st person narrator 'I'
        3rd person approach: to narrate what happened to someone else by using pronouns he, she, or they.
        2) logical organization of sequence: following a chronological order and using flashbacks and flash-forwards;
        3) selection of narrative details.[my tears shoved up]
