1) Do you agree or disagree with Kaplan’s theory? What are its implications in your study of English writing? 
I don't agree. There are many different writing styles of Chinese native speakers which cannot be simplely sumed up into a diagram as Kaplan applied.
Kaplan's research implicates that the straightforward writing pattern is favored by the native English, which is a good thing. We can pay more time to the content rather than the writing pattern. 
2) Kaplan’s research was published more than half a century ago. Do you think his findings are out of date?  Do you have any new discoveries from present-day English writings in cross-cultural or intercultural communications? 
I think so. At least it is no longer appropriate for Chinese writing. As we all know Baguwen (Stereotyped writing) is the only official writing style at the time when Kaplen did the research. But it is not the same situation nowadays.
