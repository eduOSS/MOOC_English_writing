My Understanding of China-Australia Relation: Problems and Prospects
- - - - - - - 

# Problems
  There are three kind of problems in the history of China Australia relation namely racial conflicts, third party problems and trade problems.

## Racial conflicts
  As I knew there are mainly two reasons for the Australia racial conflictss that days. Firstly, competition. It is said that there were about 40 thousand Chinese living in Australia in the year of 1858. They had several features including hard-working, gambling, opium smoking, etc. Searching only for gold, they did they best to find all gold they would find even in the closed mine. Because of this competition the white fought against Chinese settling in Australia. Secondly, theory. Apart from competition, the theory of social darwinism is also an important factor leaded to the White Australia Policy afterwards. Australian who held this opinion often thought that they are the advanced race and the Chinese is like animals as dogs, wolf and etc. To build a country with bright future Chinese and other colored people should be deported. 
  Opposit to the White Australia Policy, in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 the government said a multi-racialism country is rational and necessary. But that did not change the situation quickly. In the 1990s there are many students went there for further study. Many students were treated unequally by their professors and classmates.
  Do the Chinese face such problems nowadays? Compared to most other countries, No. Compared to a theoretical ideal, Yes. Even though many people agree that Australia is still a racist country, but the colored with competency will always be respected. How people view the question of whether or not Australia is a racilist country or not in survey?
  Those grew up with the White Australia Policy are always terribly embarrassingly racist. Who these racilism discriminate? Normaly speaking all other races except those come from southern Europeans. A 12-year-survey, conducted by leading unniversities, found NSW and QLD to be tthe most racist state, while Victoria was one of the most tolerant. 23.8% amoung 12512 people surveyed Australia-wide were negative towards Asians. Chinese is not the most who are unwelcome, the most discriinated is the Aboriginal and the Muslims.

## Tird party problems
  Or this can be said as problems of international relations. Australia is weak in military power and need a country for save guard. Before the Second World War his brother is Britain and after 1945 is America. Other countries such as Japan and Russia have very important strategic importance to him.
  British not only roled as a protector but also a scapegoat. Each time the Chinese Government argued right for Australian Chinese the Australia government would say turn to the British government in the after 19th and early 20th century. But British is too far away from them and with its influence in the world reduce Australia hope to find a new guard.
