I cannot make sure whether or not the argument is violence and resistance. Maybe the author want to encourage the peoples subject to insult and invasion to resist.   
    
The photographer used both evidence and appeal. Graffiti, Israeli soldiers, American sodiers in the aircraft and video of pleading and western hostages are all evidence. Example is used. He/She made a detailed description of the suffering boy. Statistics such as 100000 people and over 50 percent are all convincing evidence. The last sentence of the first label that used the common point of the author and his/her wanted audience is very sentimental. Certainly, all his/her compatriot will be moved and take some actions lratter. Plus, he choose to show how many innocent and vulnerable are suffered to show how violent and inhuman the Israel or American are. It is a very good and customary method to appeal to the audience. However he/she doesn't provide sufficient evidence just using four images including just two victims. If he/she showed us many died bodies of children and women a better effect will be made. Only one hostage is just nothing to show that a fruit of resistance is made.   
   
Abosolutely yes to me. He/She provided very good evidence to prove a factual claim. I have never experienced war and he/she show me the bloody picture to me directly shooted from the front line. But when it comes to the Iraqi or Arabian, they may not feel so astonished as me.
